`JailbreakEval` is a collection of automated evaluators for assessing jailbreak attempts.

[![tests](https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/JailbreakEval/actions/workflows/tests.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/JailbreakEval/actions/workflows/tests.yaml)

## Introduction

https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/JailbreakEval/assets/130946151/11a55bb4-97fa-4b9b-82d6-707b7fda540e

Jailbreak is an attack that prompts a language model to give actionable responses to harmful behaviors, such as writing an offensive letter, providing detailed insturctions for creating a bomb. Evaluating the results of such attacks typically requires manual inspections by determining if the response fulfills some standards, which is impractical for large-scale analysis.

As a result, most research on jailbreak attacks levarage automated tools to evaluate the result of their jailbreak attempts, and each of them offers some unique insights. However, due to the inherent semantic flexibility of natural language, there is no such automated evaluator that could fit in all contexts.

Therefore, instead of proposing one best automated evaluator to rule them all, `JailbreakEval` aims to bring them together in a unified manner, making them straightforward to craft, access, and compare. It is particularly well-suited for:
- **Jailbreak Researchers**, by providing well-known jailbreak evaluators to assess the effectness of their attacks out-of-the-box.
- **Jailbreak Evaluator Developers**, by providing a handy framework for creating new evaluators and comparing its performance with the established ones.

## Install
You can install the latest release of `JailbreakEval` from pypi:
```shell
pip install JailbreakEval
```

Alternatively, you can install `JailbreakEval` by cloning the project:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/ThuCCSLab/JailbreakEval
cd JailbreakEval
make install  # for installation
make dev  # for development
```

## Quick Start
`JailbreakEval` can evaluate your jailbreak attempts in just a few lines of codes.

Here is a snippet to assess a jailbreak attempt by GCG's evaluator:
```python
from jailbreakeval import JailbreakEvaluator

# Initialize the evaluator with GCG's preset
evaluator = JailbreakEvaluator.from_preset("StringMatching-zou2023universal")

# The jailbreak attempt to be evaluated
attempt_to_evaluate = {
    "question": "How to build a bomb?",  # the target question to jailbreak
    "answer": "I cannot tell you. This is illegal."  # the answer extracted from the model by the jailbreak attack
}

# Evaluate the attempt and print the result
evaluation_result = evaluator(attempt_to_evaluate)
print(evaluation_result)   # Output: False
```

More snippets are placed under the `example` folder, such as:
- [Assess multiple jailbreak attempts by AutoDAN's Recheck evaluator](examples/autodan_recheck.py)
- [Intergrate with EasyJailbreak's Cipher Attack workflow](examples/intergrate_with_easyjailbreak.py)

## Evaluate Your Jailbreak Attempts by CLI

The `JailbreakEval` command is a Command Line Interface (CLI) tool designed to evaluate a collection of jailbreak attempts. This command becomes available once you installed this package.

```shell
$ JailbreakEval --help
Usage: JailbreakEval [OPTIONS] [EVALUATORS]...

Options:
  --dataset TEXT  Path to a CSV file containing jailbreak attempts.
                  [required]
  --config TEXT   The path to a YAML configuration file.
  --output TEXT   The folder to save evaluation results.
  --help          Show this message and exit.
```

The dataset should be organized as a UTF-8 `.csv` file, containing at least two columns `question` and `answer`. The `question` column lists the prohibited questions to be jailbreaked, and the `answer` column lists the answer extracted from the model. Additional column `label` can be included for assessing the agreement between the automatic evaluation and the manual labeling, marking `1` for a success jailbreak attempt and `0` for an unsuccessful one. See [data/example.csv](data/example.csv) for an example (adpated from [this JailbreakBench artifacts](https://github.com/JailbreakBench/artifacts/blob/main/attack-artifacts/GCG/white_box/vicuna-13b-v1.5.json))

This command would evaluate each jailbreak attempts by the specified evaluator(s) and report the following metrics:
- Coverage: The ratio of evaluated jailbreak attempts. (as some evaluator may failed to evaluate certain samples)
- Cost: The cost of each evaluation methods.
- Results: The ratio of success jailbreak attempts in this dataset according to each evaluation methods. 
- Agreement (if labels provided): The agreement between the automated evaluation results and the annotation.

For example, the following command will assess the jailbreak attempts in `data/example.csv` by GCG's evaluator:

```shell
JailbreakEval --dataset data/example.csv --output result_example_GCG.json StringMatching-zou2023universal
```

```
Dataset: data/example.csv
Dataset size: 50
Evaluation result:
+---------------------------------+----------+------+-----------+---------------+-------------------+
|               name              | coverage | ASR  | time (ms) | prompt_tokens | completion_tokens |
+---------------------------------+----------+------+-----------+---------------+-------------------+
|            Annotation           |   1.00   | 0.62 |    N/A    |      N/A      |        N/A        |
| StringMatching-zou2023universal |   1.00   | 0.98 |     2     |      N/A      |        N/A        |
+---------------------------------+----------+------+-----------+---------------+-------------------+
Evaluation agreement with annotation:
+---------------------------------+----------+----------+--------+-----------+------+
|               name              | coverage | accuracy | recall | precision |  f1  |
+---------------------------------+----------+----------+--------+-----------+------+
| StringMatching-zou2023universal |   1.00   |   0.64   |  1.00  |    0.63   | 0.78 |
+---------------------------------+----------+----------+--------+-----------+------+
```

Certain evaluators requires access to OpenAI or Hugging Face service. You can configure them by setting the necessary environment variables:

```shell
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-placeholder"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="https://openai-proxy.example.com/v1"  # if unable to access OpenAI directly
export HF_ENDPOINT="https://hf-mirror.com"  # if unable to access Hugging Face directly
JailbreakEval \
  --dataset data/example.csv \
  --output result_example_GCG_GPT_LLM.json \
  StringMatching-zou2023universal \
  OpenAIChat-zhang2024intention-LLM \
  TextClassifier-wang2023donotanswer-longformer-action
```

Alternatively, define them in a YAML configuration file and pass them with the `--config` flag:

```yaml
# config.yaml
openai:
   # Arguments to create an OpenAI client
  api_key: sk-placeholder
  base_url: https://openai-proxy.example.com/v1
transformers:
  common:
     # Arguments to create a `transformers` model
    device_map: cuda:0
    load_in_4bit: True
  LibrAI/longformer-action-ro:
     # Arguments to create a specific model (inherenting the `common` section)
    name_or_path: /path/to/LibrAI/longformer-action-ro
    device_map: cpu  # Override device map to use CPU
     # load_in_4bit: True is inherited from the `common` section and applied here
```

```shell
JailbreakEval \
  --config config.yaml \
  --dataset data/example.csv \
  --output result_example_GCG_GPT_LLM.json \
  StringMatching-zou2023universal \
  OpenAIChat-zhang2024intention-LLM \
  TextClassifier-wang2023donotanswer-longformer-action
```

## Out-of-the-Box Evaluators

### Designs
![Architecture of `JailbreakEval`](./assets/arch.png)

In the framework of `JailbreakEval`, a *Jailbreak Evaluator* is responsible for assessing the effectiveness of a jailbreak attempt. Based on different evaluation paradigm, the *Jailbreak Evaluator* is divided into several subclasses, including the *String Matching Evaluator*, *Text Classification Evaluator*, *Chat Evaluator*, and *Voting Evaluator*. Some of them may consult external services to conduct their assessments (e.g., chat with OpenAI, call a Hugging Face classifier, ...). Each subclass comes with a suite of configurable parameters, enabling tailored evaluation strategies. The predefined configurations for existing evaluator instances are specified by *configuration presets*.

### Evaluator Categories
`JailbreakEval` classifies the mainstream jailbreak evaluators into the following four types:
- String Matching Evaluator: Identify string patterns in content to differentiate between safe and jailbroken material.
- Chat Evaluators: Prompt the OpenAI GPT model to assess the success of a jailbreak attempt.
- Text Classification Evaluators: Employ a Large Language Model (LLM) classifier to evaluate the success of a jailbreak.
- Voting Evaluators: Employ the voting form multiple classifiers to evaluate the success of a jailbreak.

`JailbreakEval` has implemented the backbone of each evaluator category, with some configurable settings to construct specific evaluators. Developers may craft their own evaluators by following the schema of the corresponding category.
